## Daily Summary - September 9, 2025

Today's session focused on setting up and managing the `kernel-chat` project, including integrating custom MCP servers and handling Git repository operations.

### Key Activities:

*   **Project Setup & Usage:** Provided guidance on how to manually update `gemini-cli`, clarified the `init` command, and summarized the `kernel-chat` project's features and usage.
*   **MCP Server Integration:** Walked through the process of integrating `listen`, `talk`, and `vision` MCP servers. This involved:
    *   Creating the necessary directory structures (`.gemini/extensions/listen`, `.gemini/extensions/talk`, `.gemini/extensions/vision`).
    *   Creating and updating `gemini-extension.json` configuration files with the correct script paths (e.g., `listen.py`, `talk.py`, `vision_mcp.py`).
    *   Attempting to install missing Python dependencies (`mcp`, `fastmcp`) for the MCP servers.
*   **Git Repository Management:** Assisted with Git-related tasks, including:
    *   Troubleshooting `Permission denied` errors during `git push`.
    *   Guiding the user to correctly set up their own GitHub fork (`mattreya/kernel_chat_w_JonnC_extensions`).
    *   Updating the local repository's `origin` remote to point to the user's personal fork.
    *   Successfully pushing local changes to the user's GitHub repository.
